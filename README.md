# TesLCANTest
TesLorean CAN Sender Testing Tool

I needed a simple CAN tool that would run through the Serial Monitor and allow an Arduino to send CAN frames (pre-programmed or defined on the fly).  This tool works with the MCP2515_CAN breakout board.  I use it to send test frames to the other TesLorean controller modules to test their responses.
